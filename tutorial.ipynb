    "# What is DuckDB?\n",
    "[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is a database management system originally developed by Mark Raasveldt and Hannes Mühleisen at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands and was first released in 2019. It enjoys the following properties. It is:\n",
    "- fast\n",
    "- portable\n",
    "- open-source\n",
    "- in-process\n",
    "- analytical\n",
    "- column-oriented \n",
    "- relational\n",
    "\n",
    "As of November 2025, it's latest stable release is 1.4.1. It is written in C++ and released under the MIT license. \n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB supports a [variety of languages](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/overview) for interacting with it. \n"

    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB is available as a module managed by pip, which will be easier to interface with in this notebook, as we only need Python. SQlite is also part of python itself so there is no need to install it.\n",

    "First, create a Python virtual environment. The following shell command will create a virtual environment in the current directory named 'duckdb':\n",

    "``\n",
