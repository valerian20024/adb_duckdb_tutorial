    "# What is DuckDB?\n",
    "[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is a database management system originally developed by Mark Raasveldt and Hannes Mühleisen at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands and was first released in 2019. It enjoys the following properties. It is:\n",
    "- fast\n",
    "- portable\n",
    "- open-source\n",
    "- in-process\n",
    "- analytical\n",
    "- column-oriented \n",
    "- relational\n",
    "\n",
    "As of November 2025, it's latest stable release is 1.4.1. It is written in C++ and released under the MIT license. \n"

    "# Why DuckDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now motivate why using DuckDB is a great choice for modern OLAP data workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional transactional database systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL, that are optimized for [Online Transaction Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing) (OLTP) workloads involving many small reads and writes, DuckDB targets [Online Analytical Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) (OLAP) workloads that require large scans, aggregations, and joins over big datasets. It uses a column-oriented engine with vectorized execution to process millions of rows at high speed, often outperforming both traditional databases and tools like pandas for analytical tasks. It is thus well suited to data science, machine learning, scientific computing, economy, ... Any field requiring many resources to be processed in read-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DuckDB's strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB stores data in columnar format (instead of row-by-row). This allows it to read only the columns that are needed for a query, which makes it optimal for OLAP analyses.\n",
    "DuckDB processes data in optimized batches (vectors), instead of row-by-row, which improves its speed for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB runs inside the application that is using it. There is no database server, no connection to the DBMS, which makes it really easy to use and deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB stands out as an entry-level OLAP tool due to its minimalism and accessibility, making it easier to adopt than distributed systems like [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), [Druid](https://druid.apache.org/), or [Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It offers good performance and low latencies thanks to its in-process architecture (no network overhead).\n",
    "\n",
    "IT can directly work with files and many other [formats](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/data_sources), such as CSV, parquet, JSON, ... or other  \n",
    "\n",
    "It also supports [extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/overview) to enhance its functionalities (e.g. adding support for other file formats, introducing new types, adding domain-specific functionalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "## DuckDB's limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is column-oriented, it is less suited to OLTP workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not scalable to multiple machines, there's no distributed querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has limited support for concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawback : not distributed, only one node. \n",
    "Advantage : simple, efficient. DuckDB supports a [variety of languages](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/overview) for interacting with it. \n",

    "- A recent version of python (3.9+). We would recommend a more recent version, as 3.9 is not supported anymore, yet 3.9 is the minimum version supported by DuckDB. The tutorial has been tested for versions 3.13.7. \n",

    "\n",
    "DuckDB is available as a module managed by pip, which will be easier to interface with in this notebook, as we only need Python. SQlite is also part of python itself so there is no need to install it.\n",
